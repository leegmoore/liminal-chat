# Auth Integration Test Results

## Setup Complete ✅

The Convex-Clerk integration has been successfully implemented:

1. **Installed Dependencies**: Added `convex` package to Next.js app
2. **Created ConvexClientProvider**: Set up provider component with Clerk auth integration
3. **Updated Root Layout**: Wrapped app with ConvexClientProvider inside ClerkProvider
4. **Created Test Component**: Added ConvexAuthTest component to verify integration
5. **Fixed Import Paths**: Corrected the API import path for local monorepo structure

## Services Running

- **Convex Backend**: Running at https://modest-squirrel-498.convex.cloud
- **Next.js Frontend**: Running at http://localhost:3002

## Test the Integration

1. Visit http://localhost:3002/auth-test
2. Sign in using the Clerk modal
3. Once signed in, you should see:
   - Your user information from Clerk
   - A "Convex Auth Integration Test" box showing:
     - ✅ Successfully authenticated with Convex!
     - Your Convex user ID and token identifier

## Next Steps

The integration is now complete. The Next.js app can:
- Authenticate users via Clerk
- Pass authentication to Convex automatically
- Make authenticated Convex queries and mutations

Any Convex function that checks `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` will now work properly when called from the Next.js app.
