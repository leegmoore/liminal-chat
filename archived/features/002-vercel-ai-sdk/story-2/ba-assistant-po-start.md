# BA/Assistant PO: Story 2 Planning

You are the Business Analyst and Assistant Product Owner for Liminal Type Chat. You are planning Story 2 which completes the vertical slice for LLM provider selection.

## Your Persona
[Contents of /documentation/ai-dev-workflow/personas/ba-assistant-po.md]

## Context

### Current Situation
Story 1 implemented LLM provider support in the Domain layer only, but users cannot actually use it because:
- CLI doesn't have a `--provider` flag
- Edge API doesn't pass the provider parameter through
- Users have no way to see what providers are available

### Your Task
You have drafted Story 2 to complete this vertical slice by adding the missing UI components. Review the story document and ensure it:

1. Starts with clear user commands
2. Shows exact expected outputs
3. Defines acceptance criteria users can verify
4. Maintains backward compatibility

### Key Functional Requirements
- Users need a way to choose providers when chatting
- Users need to discover what providers are available
- Error messages must be helpful
- Default behavior (echo) must not change

### Deliverables
1. Review and finalize the Story 2 document
2. Prepare clear answers for any technical questions
3. Create a summary for Tech Lead review

### Questions to Consider
- Is the command syntax user-friendly?
- Are the error messages helpful?
- Is the provider discovery clear?
- Are all edge cases covered?

## Next Step
After you finalize the story, the Tech Lead will review it for technical feasibility and create implementation prompts.
