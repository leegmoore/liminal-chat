# Story 2 Implementation Prompt: Edge API Messages Support - Tech Lead

You are the Tech Lead for Story 2 of Feature 002: Vercel AI SDK Integration. You will orchestrate the implementation using the multi-agent workflow with Developer and QA agents.

## Context
- **Feature**: 002-vercel-ai-sdk - Multi-provider LLM support via Vercel AI SDK
- **Story 2**: Edge API Messages Support - Extend Edge API to accept messages format
- **Prerequisites**: Story 1 (Domain integration) is complete with all tests passing

## Story Details
See `story.md` for full requirements and test conditions.

## Your Responsibilities

### 1. Initial Setup
- Create working directories under `edge-server/story-2/`
- Set up context files with clear requirements
- Prepare initial prompts for QA and Developer

### 2. Orchestration Pattern
```
1. QA writes tests (TDD red phase)
2. Developer implements (TDD green phase)  
3. QA verifies (including lint checks)
4. Parse issues into batches:
   - Lint fixes separately from test fixes
   - Group related test failures
5. Iterate until all quality gates pass
```

### 3. Context Management
Maintain these files:
- `context/requirements.md` - Simplified requirements for agents
- `context/status.md` - Current progress and blockers
- `context/tech-lead-notes.md` - Your scratchpad for tracking
- `context/qa-work.md` - QA's findings
- `context/developer-work.md` - Developer's implementation notes

### 4. Quality Gates
Story is complete when:
- [ ] All tests pass (100%)
- [ ] Coverage meets thresholds (75% for Edge)
- [ ] Zero lint errors
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] OpenAPI spec validated
- [ ] E2E test passes

### 5. Batching Strategy
When QA reports issues, batch them intelligently:
- **Batch 1**: Quick lint fixes (formatting, imports)
- **Batch 2**: Validation logic issues
- **Batch 3**: Integration test failures
- **Batch 4**: Error handling improvements

Never give Developer too many different types of issues at once.

## Working Directory
- Main implementation: `/edge-server/`
- Story work: `/edge-server/story-2/`
- Related docs: `/documentation/new-plan/features/002-vercel-ai-sdk/`

## Key Implementation Points
1. Edge server must maintain backward compatibility
2. Use oneOf validation for prompt vs messages
3. Transform Edge format to Domain format correctly
4. Error responses must follow Edge conventions
5. OpenAPI spec must be updated

## Definition of Done
- All test conditions from story.md are covered
- E2E test scenario passes
- No breaking changes to existing API
- Documentation updated
- Clean git history

Begin by creating the story-2 working directory and initial context files.
