# Feature 004: Testing Framework Modernization

## Overview
This feature modernizes and consolidates the testing architecture across all tiers of the Liminal Chat application, migrating to unified testing frameworks and establishing comprehensive testing strategies.

## Goals
- **Framework Consolidation**: Unify on Vitest for all unit tests across all tiers
- **Modern Tooling**: Implement Playwright for integration and E2E testing
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieve faster test execution and developer feedback
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Establish systematic testing across unit, integration, and E2E layers
- **Developer Experience**: Streamline testing workflows and debugging capabilities

## Architecture Transformation

### Current State (Mixed Testing)
```text
Domain:  Jest (123 unit tests) + Supertest integration
CLI:     Vitest (89 unit tests) + Custom integration  
Edge:    Vitest (6 unit tests) + Basic E2E
Total:   Mixed frameworks, fragmented approach
```

### Target State (Unified Testing)
```text
All Tiers: Vitest (unified unit testing)
Integration: Playwright HTTP API testing (Edge + Domain)
E2E: Playwright + Node child_process (CLI workflows)
Total: Unified frameworks, comprehensive strategy
```

## Stories

- Create debugging and reporting tools

**Acceptance Criteria**: Framework configured, fixtures ready, CI/CD integrated, debug tools working

---

### [Domain API Integration Tests with Playwright](3-domain-api-integration-tests/domain-api-integration-tests.md)
**Objective**: Migrate Domain API testing from Supertest to Playwright HTTP

**Key Deliverables**:
- Convert existing Supertest tests to Playwright patterns
- Add comprehensive coverage for all Domain endpoints
- Implement streaming endpoint testing
- Add error scenario validation
- Performance and timeout testing

**Acceptance Criteria**: All endpoints covered, real HTTP validation, streaming tested, performance targets met

---

### [Edge Proxy Integration Tests and Validation](4-edge-proxy-integration-tests/edge-proxy-integration-tests.md)
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive Edge API testing with Playwright

**Key Deliverables**:
- Test Edge proxy behavior validation
- Cross-tier communication testing (Edge â†’ Domain)
- Error handling and timeout scenarios
- CORS and security header validation
- Streaming proxy functionality

**Acceptance Criteria**: Proxy behavior validated, cross-tier communication tested, security headers verified

---

### [CLI End-to-End Test Automation](5-cli-e2e-automation/cli-e2e-automation.md)
**Objective**: Implement CLI testing using Playwright + Node child_process

**Key Deliverables**:
- CLI batch mode testing (non-interactive commands)
- CLI interactive mode testing (prompts, sessions)
- Configuration and authentication workflows
- Error handling and edge cases
- Cross-platform compatibility validation

**Acceptance Criteria**: All CLI commands tested, interactive mode working, error scenarios covered

---

### [Testing Documentation and Developer Playbook](6-testing-documentation-playbook/testing-documentation-playbook.md)
**Objective**: Create comprehensive testing guidelines and documentation

**Key Deliverables**:
- Testing strategy playbook and guidelines
- Developer workflow documentation
- Best practices and anti-patterns guide
- CI/CD optimization documentation
- Debugging and troubleshooting guides
- Performance benchmarking guidelines

**Acceptance Criteria**: Complete documentation, team training, process integration, knowledge transfer

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Coverage**: 80% unit test coverage across all tiers
- **Performance**: Unit tests <2s, integration tests <30s, E2E tests <60s
- **Reliability**: Zero flaky tests, automated retry handling
- **Framework Consolidation**: Single testing framework (Vitest) for all unit tests

### Developer Experience Metrics
- **Onboarding**: New developers productive in <30 minutes
- **Feedback Speed**: Test results available within 5 minutes in CI
- **Debug Efficiency**: Clear failure reporting with debugging tools
- **Maintenance**: Minimal test maintenance overhead

### Operational Metrics
- **CI/CD Performance**: Complete test pipeline <10 minutes
- **Test Stability**: 95%+ test pass rate in CI
- **Coverage Trends**: Consistent coverage maintenance over time
- **Developer Adoption**: 100% team adoption of new testing practices

## Dependencies

### Story Dependencies
- **Story 1**: Independent (can start immediately)
- **Story 2**: Independent (can start immediately) 
- **Story 3**: Depends on Story 2 (Playwright setup)
- **Story 4**: Depends on Story 2 (Playwright setup)
- **Story 5**: Depends on Story 2 (Playwright setup)
- **Story 6**: Depends on Stories 1-5 (implementation completion)

### Parallel Execution
- **Phase 1**: Stories 1 and 2 (can run in parallel)
- **Phase 2**: Stories 3, 4, and 5 (can run in parallel after Story 2)
- **Phase 3**: Story 6 (after all implementation stories)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Breaking changes**: Thorough testing at each migration step
- **Performance regression**: Benchmark before/after migration
- **NestJS compatibility**: SWC plugin resolves historical issues
- **CI/CD disruption**: Parallel implementation with existing tests

### Process Risks
- **Developer adoption**: Clear documentation and training
- **Test maintenance**: Automated health monitoring
- **Knowledge gaps**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Timeline pressure**: Prioritized story execution with fallback plans

## Getting Started

### For Developers
1. Read the [Testing Strategy Playbook](story-6/story.md#testing-strategy-playbook)
2. Follow the [Developer Workflow Guide](story-6/story.md#developer-workflow-guide)
3. Reference [Best Practices](story-6/story.md#testing-best-practices-guide)
4. Use [Debugging Guide](story-6/story.md#debugging-and-troubleshooting-guide) when needed

### For Implementation
1. Start with **Story 1** and **Story 2** in parallel
2. Execute **Stories 3-5** after Story 2 completion
3. Complete **Story 6** for documentation and training
4. Follow each story's acceptance criteria for validation

## Future Enhancements
- Visual regression testing capabilities
- Performance testing framework
- Test generation automation
- Cross-browser testing for web components
