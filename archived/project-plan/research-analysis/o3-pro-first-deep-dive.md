## 1. Executive Summary
Liminal Chat is a well-architected, privacy-first AI round-table platform positioned as the keystone of a broader creative-workflow ecosystem (**Liminal Type Platform**).  The technical foundations, domain/edge separation, and contract-first discipline are exemplary and **require no wholesale re-architecture**.  The project's critical path, however, contains a few *high-impact blockers* (testing framework migration, OpenRouter provider) that must be cleared immediately to avoid delivery drift.

## 2. Foundational Health-Check
| Area | Health | Observations | Immediate Action? |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Domain/Edge Separation | ‚úÖ Strong | Clear boundaries, process isolation, provider abstraction. | ‚Äî |
| Contract-First Governance | ‚úÖ Strong | JSON-Schema + TSDoc enforced, good DX. | ‚Äî |
| Dependency Hygiene | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate | Vercel AI SDK remnants; dual Jest/Vitest runners. | **Yes** ‚Äì remove legacy deps, finish Vitest.
| Streaming Model | ‚úÖ Strong | SSE plumbing, multi-stream concept proven in Echo provider. | ‚Äî |
| Persistence Strategy | ‚úÖ Strong (design) | Filesystem-first > SQLite > PG path is realistic. | ‚Äî |
| Observability | ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing | Structured logging planned (Feature 006) but no baseline yet. | Add minimal pino-pretty logger now to aid dev.
| Security | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Edge‚ÜîDomain auth postponed (Features 009-010). | Acceptable for local dev; monitor.
| CLI Strategy | üü° Emerging | CLI roles well-designed but unimplemented for multi-agent modes. | Fold into early features to support E2E tests.

**Verdict:** No existential flaws; codebase is healthy.  Attention must focus on *dependency cleanup, testing, and observability* before layering complex features.

## 3. Alignment with Expanded Vision (Liminal Flow & Microviews)
The long-term vision of a CLI-centric, composable workflow IDE meshes naturally with the current architecture:
1. **Edge API = Workflow Fabric** ‚Äì already stateless, contract-driven.
2. **Domain Services = Pluggable Agents & Storage** ‚Äì good foundation for creative artefacts (lyrics, stems, mix notes).
3. **CLI as First-Class Client** ‚Äì supports automation, batch, and scripted creative flows.
4. **Microviews** ‚Äì thin React/Next.js surfaces that subscribe to SSE streams; architecture already supports multi-stream.

No architectural pivots required; just ensure **CLI capabilities and token-based auth** are prioritised sooner to unlock workflow integrations.

## 4. Critical Risks & Mitigations
1. **Testing Framework Migration Delay**  
   *Risk*: Blocks provider integration ‚áí blocks everything.  
   *Mitigation*: Freeze new feature work, finish Vitest + Playwright baseline; aim for 80% coverage parity.<br/>
2. **OpenRouter API Volatility**  
   *Risk*: API/key policy changes could break provider.  
   *Mitigation*: Encapsulate in provider adapter; add nightly contract test hitting sandbox model.
3. **Round-table Routing Complexity (Feature 007)**  
   *Risk*: Context window & mention-parsing accuracy.  
   *Mitigation*: Isolate Gemini-Flash routing in its own service; create synthetic corpus for evaluation; integrate metrics from day 1.
4. **Multi-Stream Browser Perf**  
   *Risk*: 5-10 SSE streams may exhaust EventSource connections.  
   *Mitigation*: Shared-worker multiplexing proof-of-concept before Feature 008 UI polish.

## 5. Recommended Roadmap Adjustments
The existing roadmap is 90% correct; only *re-order two items* and *insert observability* earlier.

### Updated Phase Sequence
1. **P0 ‚Äì Stabilise Foundation**  
   ‚Ä¢ Finish Feature 004 (Vitest/Playwright)  
   ‚Ä¢ Legacy dependency purge  
   ‚Ä¢ Minimal structured logging (pino)  
   ‚Ä¢ Linters/formatters in CI
2. **P1 ‚Äì Provider & CLI Enablement**

     ‚Äì E2E test harness  
     ‚Äì Single-agent interactive & batch modes  
   ‚Ä¢ Add nightly contract tests hitting Echo + OpenRouter.
3. **P2 ‚Äì Data & Observability**  
   ‚Ä¢ Feature 005 (Persistence FS)  
   ‚Ä¢ Feature 006 (Structured Logging full)  
   ‚Ä¢ Add tracing hooks (OpenTelemetry).
4. **P3 ‚Äì Round-table Intelligence**  
   ‚Ä¢ Feature 007 (Routing)  
   ‚Ä¢ Evaluation harness, metrics dashboard.
5. **P4 ‚Äì User Experience**  
   ‚Ä¢ Feature 008 (Web UI)
