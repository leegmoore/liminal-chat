```

## Critical Path Analysis

### Blocking Dependencies
1. **Feature 004 (Testing)** blocks Feature 002 completion
2. **Feature 002 (OpenRouter)** blocks all data persistence work
3. **Feature 007 (Roundtable)** blocks web interface development
4. **Feature 008 (Web UI)** blocks authentication implementation

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- **Documentation** can happen alongside any implementation
- **Architecture planning** for later features during early implementation
- **UI design** can happen during backend development (Phases 2-3)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items

**OpenRouter API Integration**  
*Risk*: Complex streaming implementation across tiers  
*Mitigation*: TDD approach with comprehensive mocking  
*Timeline Impact*: Could add 1-2 weeks if streaming issues arise

**Multi-Stream SSE Web UI**  
*Risk*: Browser performance with multiple simultaneous streams  
*Mitigation*: Prototype early, measure performance  
*Timeline Impact*: Could require UI redesign if performance issues

**Clerk Authentication Integration**  
*Risk*: Unfamiliar service integration complexity  
*Mitigation*: Start with basic flows, iterate  
*Timeline Impact*: Could add 1 week if integration issues

### Medium Risk Items

**File System Performance at Scale**  
*Risk*: Too many small files affecting performance  
*Mitigation*: Monitor and have SQLite migration ready  
*Timeline Impact*: Minimal - can optimize incrementally

**Edgeâ†”Domain Authentication**  
*Risk*: JWT implementation complexity  
*Mitigation*: Use established patterns from architecture docs  
*Timeline Impact*: Well-defined scope, minimal risk
