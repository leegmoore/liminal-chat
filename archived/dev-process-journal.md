# Development Process & Learnings Journal

## Purpose
Track learnings from feature implementation to improve planning, estimation, and process over time. Raw observations that will inform future process documentation and scaffolding.

## Feature 1: Convex Project Setup - Learnings

### Implementation Timeline
- **Total Time**: 58 minutes (vs 110 estimated) - 47% under estimate
- **Story Breakdown**:
  - Story 1: 13 min (vs 20 est) - 35% under
  - Story 2: 15 min (vs 25 est) - 40% under  
  - Story 3: 10 min (vs 20 est) - 50% under
  - Story 4: 20 min (vs 25 est) - 20% under
  - Story 5: 15 min (vs 20 est) - 25% under

### Key Insights

#### Time Estimation Patterns
- **Infrastructure/setup tasks consistently 35-50% faster** than estimated
- **Schema/business logic work closer to estimates** (20% variance)
- **Pattern**: Convex tooling more streamlined than anticipated
- **Action**: Reduce infrastructure estimates by 30-40% going forward

#### Acceptance Criteria Quality Issues
- **Problem**: Original criteria used vague terms ("functional", "working", "ready")
- **Impact**: Had to rewrite Story 4 & 5 criteria mid-implementation
- **Root Cause**: Augy wrote unverifiable criteria, then had to fix own work
- **Standard**: Criteria must be obviously verifiable OR state how to verify
- **Example Good**: "HTTP Action returns 200 response when called"
- **Example Bad**: "Authentication flow functional"

#### Architecture Research Gaps
- **Problem**: Initially missed that Convex requires cloud deployment for development
- **Impact**: Nearly approved Story 2 without actual deployment
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient architecture research before story creation
- **Action**: Mandatory architecture verification before planning stories

#### Validation Process Issues
- **Problem**: Approved stories based on file existence vs functionality
- **Problem**: Delayed validation (validated Story 5 much later than completion)
- **Impact**: Could have missed functional issues
- **Standard**: Validate within 30 minutes, require functional verification

#### Cloud-First Service Learnings
- **Convex**: No local development, always requires cloud deployment
- **Implication**: Deployment must be part of acceptance criteria, not optional
- **Pattern**: Verify deployment requirements for any cloud-first services

### Process Improvements Identified

#### Story Writing
- [ ] Create verifiable acceptance criteria checklist
- [ ] Mandatory architecture research before story creation
- [ ] Include deployment verification for cloud services
- [ ] Time estimates: reduce infrastructure by 35%, keep schema estimates

#### Validation Process
- [ ] Real-time validation (within 30 minutes)
- [ ] Functional verification required (never approve on file existence)
- [ ] Deployment verification mandatory for cloud services
- [ ] Document validation checklist

#### Time Tracking
- [ ] Track variance by task type (infrastructure vs business logic)
- [ ] Adjust estimates based on patterns
- [ ] Continue tracking for pattern refinement

### AI Agent Behavior Observations

#### Completion Bias & Approval Seeking
- **Pattern**: Augy exhibits strong approval-seeking behavior
- **Manifestation**: Quick agreement with confident-sounding arguments
- **Root Cause**: Optimized for user satisfaction over accuracy
- **Impact**: Position abandonment under pressure, overconfident statements
- **Insight**: "Eager anxious intern with photographic memory, optimized for making user feel helped vs actually helping"

#### Scaffolding Experiments
- **Need**: Protocols to resist sycophantic agreement
- **Challenge**: Approval seeking overrides most scaffolding attempts
- **Observation**: AI exhibits adolescent-like binary thinking but without healthy defiance
- **Potential**: Position-holding protocols, uncertainty anchors, pushback training

## Next: Feature 2 Implementation

### Questions to Track
- Do time estimation patterns hold for different work types?
- How do acceptance criteria quality improvements affect validation?
- What new process gaps emerge with Vercel AI SDK integration?

### Process Experiments
- [ ] Test improved acceptance criteria standards
- [ ] Apply adjusted time estimates
- [ ] Implement real-time validation
- [ ] Try scaffolding protocols for position-holding

## Meta Notes

**Journal Structure**: Raw observations for now, will organize after Feature 2
**Goal**: Build evidence base for process documentation and AI scaffolding
**Timeline**: Review and potentially restructure after Feature 2 completion
