# Story 3: Development Environment Configuration

## Objective
Establish a complete development environment with proper tooling, hot reloading, and deployment pipeline for efficient development workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Local development workflow established
- [ ] Hot reloading works for schema and function changes
- [ ] Environment variables properly managed
- [ ] Convex dashboard accessible and functional
- [ ] TypeScript compilation works without errors
- [ ] Deployment to Convex cloud successful

## Implementation Tasks
1. Configure development scripts in `package.json`
2. Set up environment variable management (`.env.local`)
3. Configure hot reloading for Convex functions
4. Test Convex dashboard connectivity
5. Set up TypeScript watch mode
6. Configure deployment pipeline to Convex cloud
7. Test full development workflow

## Definition of Done
- `pnpm dev` starts complete development environment
- Changes to Convex functions trigger hot reload
- TypeScript compilation happens automatically
- Convex dashboard shows project data correctly
- Deployment to cloud works without errors
- Development workflow supports rapid iteration

## Estimated Time
20 minutes

## Dependencies
- Story 1: Convex Project Initialization (needs project structure)
- Story 2: Clerk Authentication Setup (needs auth config)

## Blocks
- Story 4: Core Database Schema Setup
- All subsequent features requiring development environment
