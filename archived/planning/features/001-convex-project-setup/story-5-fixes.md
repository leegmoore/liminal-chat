# Story 5 - Implementation Exploration

## Note: This Document Describes an Exploration That Was Not Implemented

This document describes an exploration of using Node.js functionality in Convex.
The approach described here (creating nodeActions.ts with "use node" directive) 
was tested but ultimately not included in the final implementation.

### 1. Exploration: "use node" Directive in Separate File
- Explored creating separate `convex/nodeActions.ts` file with "use node" directive
- This would be the correct way to use Node.js in Convex (not in http.ts directly)

### 2. ✅ Environment Variables Reading
- Test endpoint reads and returns environment variables
- Shows all available env vars: CONVEX_CLOUD_URL, CONVEX_SITE_URL, TZ, PWD, etc.
- Note: CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT is not available in the runtime, but we handle it gracefully

### 3. ✅ Node.js-Specific Functionality Demonstrated
- **crypto.randomUUID()** - Generates UUIDs using Node.js crypto
- **crypto.createHash()** - Creates SHA-256 hashes
- **crypto.randomBytes()** - Generates random bytes and converts to base64
- **Buffer operations** - Uses Node.js Buffer to encode/decode
- **process information** - Shows nodeVersion, platform, arch, pid, uptime
- **System metrics** - Memory usage, CPU usage, and other Node.js runtime info

## Endpoints Working

### /test endpoint
```bash
curl -X GET https://cheerful-donkey-992.convex.site/test
```
Returns:
- Node.js features (UUID, hash, random bytes, buffer operations)
- Environment variables (all available ones)
- System information (node version, platform, architecture)
- Authentication status

### /health endpoint
```bash
curl -X GET https://cheerful-donkey-992.convex.site/health
```
Returns:
- Database connectivity status
- System information (memory, CPU, uptime)
- Deployment information
- Health status

## Implementation Details

1. **convex/nodeActions.ts** - Contains Node.js-specific actions with "use node" directive
2. **convex/http.ts** - HTTP endpoints that call the Node.js actions
3. **@types/node** - Added to devDependencies for TypeScript support
4. **tsconfig.json** - Updated to include Node types

## Final Implementation Status

**IMPORTANT**: While this exploration successfully demonstrated Node.js functionality in Convex,
the final implementation in the codebase does NOT include nodeActions.ts or any Node.js-specific
features. The /test and /health endpoints were implemented with basic Convex functionality only.

For the actual implementation, see `story-5-implementation-notes.md`.
