# Process Learning & Prompt Update To-Dos

## Debrief: Scope Underestimation in Feature 002 Story 2

### What Happened

#### Story 2 Scope Issue
- **Planned**: "Add SSE streaming" - seemed like a straightforward feature enhancement
- **Reality**: Production-grade streaming system with network resilience, UTF-8 handling, performance monitoring, error taxonomy, and cross-tier integration
- **Result**: 7 tasks, 554-line specification, 45+ minute implementation that took significantly longer

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Capability Complexity Underestimation**: Streaming isn't an add-on feature - it's a fundamental architectural capability touching every system layer
2. **Scope Creep During Design**: Started as "basic streaming" but proper implementation required network resilience, error handling, performance monitoring
3. **Warning Signs Ignored**: 554-line story spec, 7-task breakdown, detailed technical architecture - all indicators this was feature-level work
4. **Context Loss Over Extended Work**: By Task 7, lost sight of original planned scope, treating intentional decisions (skipped E2E tests) as gaps

**Key Insight:** The detailed technical design wasn't over-engineering - it was necessary scaffolding. The issue was attempting to implement a complete streaming system in a single story rather than recognizing it needed decomposition.

### What We Learned

#### Good Decisions
- Building comprehensive streaming foundation rather than technical debt
- Detailed interface definitions prevented inconsistent implementation choices  
- Production-ready implementation won't need significant rework for conversation persistence
- Architecture is extensible rather than brittle

#### Process Failures
- Didn't recognize story specification size as scope indicator
- Attempted feature-level complexity in story-level timeframe
- Lost track of original scope over extended implementation
- Treated necessary capability complexity as simple feature addition

**Core Learning:** Streaming is inherently complex due to network unreliability, partial data scenarios, resource management, and real-time performance requirements. "Simple streaming" would have created technical debt requiring fundamental rework.

## Action Items: Prompt Updates

### 1. Praxis System Prompt Updates

**Add Scope Detection Guardrails:**

```markdown
## Story Scope Validation

Before committing to story implementation, validate scope appropriateness:

**Automatic Scope Review Triggers:**
- Story specification >200 lines
- Requires >5 implementation tasks  
- Estimated total time >30 minutes
- Requires "complete technical architecture" upfront
- Touches multiple system tiers for "simple" change
- Creates >3 new files or interfaces

**When triggers fire:**
1. **STOP** - Do not proceed with story as planned
2. **Assess** - Is this actually feature-level complexity?
3. **Decompose** - Break into 2-3 smaller, independently valuable stories
4. **Validate** - Each decomposed story should provide standalone user value

**Scope Right-Sizing Questions:**
- Can we deliver meaningful user value with 2-3 tasks?
- Are we building infrastructure (feature) or enhancing capability (story)?
- Would a human team consider this a single work unit?
- Is the technical complexity inherent or are we over-engineering?

**Default to smaller scope** - Better to deliver working slices iteratively than attempt complex implementations in single stories.
```

### 2. Claude System Prompt Updates  

**Add Planning Phase Scope Vigilance:**

```markdown
## Scope Underestimation Defense

When reviewing or creating technical designs for stories, actively guard against scope underestimation:

**Red Flags - Challenge Story Scope:**
- Writing detailed interface definitions during story planning
- Designing cross-tier integration patterns  
- Specifying performance requirements and memory management
- Creating comprehensive error taxonomies
- Planning "production-ready" implementations

**When Red Flags Appear:**
1. **Flag scope concern** - "This technical complexity suggests feature-level work"
2. **Propose decomposition** - Suggest 2-3 smaller stories with clear boundaries
3. **Question necessity** - "Do we need full production capability now or can we start simpler?"
4. **Recommend phased approach** - Basic capability first, resilience/optimization later

**Implementation Phase Triggers:**
- Task 1 takes >2x planned time → immediate scope reassessment
- New complexity emerges during early tasks → stop and re-plan  
- Creating substantial technical infrastructure → validate scope appropriateness
- "This is harder than expected" → default to scope reduction

**Scope Escalation Protocol:**
When scope concerns arise, immediately surface the question: "Should we deliver a smaller, working slice now and tackle the complexity later?" Default to YES unless compelling reason for full complexity.
```

### 3. Process Refinement

**Planning Phase Checklist:**
- [ ] Story specification <200 lines?
- [ ] Requires ≤5 tasks?
- [ ] Estimated time ≤30 minutes?
- [ ] Provides standalone user value?
- [ ] Avoids cross-tier complexity?
- [ ] No "complete technical architecture" needed?

**If any checklist item fails → Automatic scope review**

**Implementation Phase Checkpoints:**
- After Task 1: "On track with original scope estimate?"
- After Task 2: "Any emerging complexity requiring scope adjustment?"  
- Before final tasks: "Delivering against original story objectives?"

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Update Claude system prompt with scope detection guidelines
2. **High Priority**: Update Praxis with story scope validation rules
3. **Medium Priority**: Create planning phase checklist template
4. **Medium Priority**: Establish implementation checkpoint processes

## Success Metrics

#### Planning Improvement
- Stories consistently ≤30 minutes implementation time
- Story specifications ≤200 lines
- Reduced need for mid-story scope adjustments

#### Implementation Quality
- Maintained focus on original story objectives throughout implementation
- Clear boundaries between stories and features
- Better predictability of story completion timeframes
