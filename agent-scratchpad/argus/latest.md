**COMPLETED** - Actionable findings provided below.

---

## Critical Findings

### üî¥ BLOCKING - Cross-Story Coordination Gap
**Issue**: Documentation states Stories 1 & 2 can run in parallel, but Story 2's Playwright setup references dependencies that Story 1 creates.

**Evidence**:
- Story 2 Playwright config references `apps/domain && pnpm start:dev` 
- Story 1 removes Jest and changes `package.json` scripts in Domain
- Story 2's test execution depends on Domain being properly configured

**Impact**: Parallel implementation could result in broken test infrastructure during transition.

**Action Required**: Define explicit coordination checkpoints:
1. Story 1 must complete Vitest installation before Story 2 references Domain scripts
2. Both stories must coordinate on shared test configuration patterns
3. Establish rollback procedures if either story blocks the other

### üî¥ BLOCKING - Missing Migration Validation Strategy
**Issue**: No verification mechanism to ensure 123 existing Jest tests maintain identical behavior after Vitest migration.

**Evidence**: 
- Story 1 AC states "All tests passing" but provides no baseline capture mechanism
- No diff validation between Jest and Vitest test outputs
- Risk of silent behavioral changes in mock patterns or async handling

**Action Required**:
1. Capture Jest test output as baseline before migration
2. Implement side-by-side comparison validation during transition
3. Define specific behavioral validation beyond just "tests pass"

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY - Incomplete Error Recovery Patterns
**Issue**: Both stories lack comprehensive failure recovery and debugging procedures.

**Evidence**:
- Story 1 rollback plan mentions "revert to Jest" but no specific steps
- Story 2 has no rollback procedures for Playwright installation
- No guidance for partial failure scenarios (e.g., some tests migrate successfully, others fail)

**Action Required**: Document specific rollback procedures with commands and verification steps.

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY - Missing Performance Validation Framework
**Issue**: Both stories mention performance improvements but lack measurement and validation mechanisms.

**Evidence**:
- Story 1 claims "<2s per suite" but no baseline measurement plan
- Story 2 claims "5 seconds startup" but no benchmarking approach
- No continuous performance monitoring during migration

**Action Required**: Define performance measurement methodology and success thresholds.

## Specification Analysis

### Story 1: Jest to Vitest Migration

#### ‚úÖ Well Defined Requirements
- **Scope**: Clear 123 test migration target
- **Technical specs**: Proper SWC + NestJS configuration provided
- **Dependencies**: Correctly specified with versions
- **Acceptance criteria**: Comprehensive and measurable

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Requiring Clarification
1. **Migration grouping strategy**: Should core domain logic migrate first, or all tests simultaneously?
2. **Dual execution period**: How long should Jest and Vitest run in parallel for validation?
3. **Coverage threshold enforcement**: Will migration fail if coverage drops below 75%?

#### üîß Technical Architecture Review
- **SWC Configuration**: ‚úÖ Appropriate for NestJS metadata handling
- **Vitest Config**: ‚úÖ Proper globals, environment, and coverage setup
- **Mock Migration**: ‚úÖ Clear jest.fn() ‚Üí vi.fn() patterns documented

- **Configuration**: Detailed Playwright config with proper projects
- **Fixtures**: Well-architected reusable patterns
- **CI/CD integration**: Proper artifact collection and reporting

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Requiring Clarification
1. **Server lifecycle management**: What happens if servers fail to start during tests?
2. **Test isolation**: How to ensure tests don't interfere with each other?
3. **Resource cleanup**: What cleanup is needed between test runs?

#### üîß Technical Architecture Review
- **Multi-project setup**: ‚úÖ Proper separation of integration and E2E concerns
- **Base fixtures**: ‚úÖ Good abstraction patterns for reusability  
- **CLI testing approach**: ‚úÖ Solid child process management patterns

## Risk Assessment

### High-Impact Risks

1. **NestJS + Vitest Compatibility**: Despite documentation claims, some edge cases may exist
   - **Mitigation**: Test complex NestJS patterns first (decorators, guards, interceptors)

2. **Playwright Server Management**: Complex multi-server startup could be flaky
   - **Mitigation**: Implement robust health check and retry patterns

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Disruption**: Changes could break existing automation
   - **Mitigation**: Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

### Medium-Impact Risks

1. **Developer Adoption**: Team may resist new testing patterns
   - **Mitigation**: Provide clear migration examples and troubleshooting guides

2. **Performance Regression**: Migration could be slower than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Establish clear performance baselines and rollback triggers

---

## Pre-Implementation Recommendations

### Before Starting Story 1 (Jest to Vitest)
1. **Capture baseline**: Run full Jest suite and capture timing/output metrics
2. **Environment validation**: Verify SWC works with current NestJS patterns
3. **Migration order**: Define which test suites migrate first (recommend core domain logic)
4. **Validation approach**: Set up side-by-side execution for critical tests

### Before Starting Story 2 (Playwright Setup)
1. **Server stability**: Ensure Domain and Edge servers have reliable startup/shutdown
2. **Port management**: Verify no port conflicts in development environment
3. **CI capacity**: Ensure CI environment can handle Playwright browser requirements
4. **Fixture patterns**: Review and approve base fixture architecture before implementation

### Cross-Story Coordination
1. **Communication protocol**: Establish daily sync points between Story 1 & 2 implementers
2. **Shared configuration**: Agree on common TypeScript/testing configuration patterns
3. **Integration testing**: Plan joint validation once both stories complete

# Argus QA Analysis - Feature 004 Story 3: Domain API Integration Tests
**Analysis Date**: June 2025  
**Analysis Type**: Implementation Review  
**Focus**: Playwright‚Äêbased Domain API Integration Tests (`story3-domain-api-integration` worktree)

## R.I.V.E.T. Analysis Summary

### Requirements Deconstruction ‚ö†Ô∏è
*Specification vs Implementation drift detected.*

### Implementation Scrutiny ‚ö†Ô∏è
*Tests pass against running services, but diverge from stated acceptance criteria.*

### Vulnerability & Edge-Case Analysis üü°
*Good breadth of scenarios, but critical validation gaps remain.*

### Evidence-Based Verdict üî¥
*BLOCKING ISSUES PRESENT ‚Äì specification mismatch and error-handling gaps.*

### Ticket-Ready Report ‚úì
*Detailed findings documented below.*

---

## Critical Findings

| ID | Severity | Category | Description | Evidence |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| F3-1 | üî¥ BLOCKER | Spec Drift | `GET /health` path & response schema in spec differs from implemented `/domain/health` path & fields (`status:"healthy"`, `service:"domain"`). | Spec lines 20-32 vs `tests/integration/domain/health.spec.ts` lines 16-34. |
| F3-2 | üî¥ BLOCKER | Spec Drift | Streaming endpoint defined as `POST /domain/llm/prompt` with `stream=true` in spec, but tests target `/domain/llm/prompt/stream`. | Spec DomainEndpoints, Streaming section vs `streaming.spec.ts` lines 19-35. |
| F3-3 | üî¥ BLOCKER | Validation Logic | Spec expects 400 with explicit validation message (`prompt or messages required`). Actual API returns `500 ‚Äì INTERNAL_ERROR`; tests assert this internal error, masking bug. | `domain-api-integration-tests.md` Error Handling section vs `error-scenarios.spec.ts` lines 88-104, 233-259. |
| F3-4 | üü† HIGH | Performance Criteria | Spec mandates `<100 ms` for Health and `<5 s` for LLM prompt. Health test loosens to `500 ms`; no performance assertion on non-stream LLM prompt. | `health.spec.ts` line 5 threshold 500; missing timing checks in `llm-prompt.spec.ts`. |
| F3-5 | üü† HIGH | CI Reliability | Playwright config omits `webServer` section ‚Äì tests assume Domain service pre-running. CI may fail if service isn't up, violating "CI/CD compatibility" AC. | `playwright.config.integration.ts` lines 40-55 (comment *No webServer*). |
| F3-6 | üü° MEDIUM | Code Quality | Repeated inline `apiContext` overrides; violates DRY & increases maintenance risk. Should extend fixtures instead. | All domain spec files lines 7-22. |
| F3-7 | üü° MEDIUM | Script Duplication | `package.json` defines duplicate `test:integration` and related scripts ‚Äì potential maintenance confusion. | `package.json` lines ~25-70. |
| F3-8 | üü° MEDIUM | Acceptance Criteria Coverage | No dedicated `performance.spec.ts`; streaming tests don't assert `delta`, `model` fields suggested by spec. | Spec Performance & Streaming sections vs `streaming.spec.ts`. |
| F3-9 | üü¢ LOW | TestData Factory Usage | Factory exists but many tests construct payloads manually; inconsistent pattern usage. | `test-data.ts` vs `llm-prompt.spec.ts` etc. |

---

## Additional Observations

1. **Event Terminology** ‚Äì Spec uses `[DONE]` sentinel, implementation expects `event: done`. Confirm desired format.
2. **Error-Code Taxonomy** ‚Äì Tests allow wide range of provider error codes. Lack of deterministic expectation may hide regressions.
3. **Logging in Tests** ‚Äì `console.log` statements left in committed tests add noise to CI output.
4. **Provider Health Logic** ‚Äì Provider discovery tests assume Echo always healthy; ensure resilient to provider-specific downtimes.

---

## Risk Assessment

*High risk of future integration breakage due to spec/implementation skew and missing CI server orchestration.*

---

## Recommended Actions (Ticket-Ready)

1. Align API paths and response schemas with specification or update spec ‚Äì choose single source of truth. (BLOCKER)
2. Fix validation logic to return proper 400 with descriptive message; update tests accordingly. (BLOCKER)
3. Standardise streaming endpoint path; ensure spec & code match. (BLOCKER)
4. Tighten performance thresholds and add LLM prompt latency assertions. (HIGH)
5. Add `webServer` startup in Playwright config (or equivalent) to guarantee CI reliability. (HIGH)
6. Refactor repeated API context into shared fixture. (MEDIUM)
7. Deduplicate `package.json` scripts to avoid confusion. (MEDIUM)
8. Expand streaming assertions to include `delta`, `model`, and termination `[DONE]` sentinel. (MEDIUM)
9. Enforce consistent use of `TestDataFactory` across tests. (LOW)
10. Remove or downgrade `console.log` statements in committed tests. (LOW)

---

## Success Validation Checklist (Story 3)
- [ ] All BLOCKER actions resolved.
- [ ] Playwright suite green in CI with self-managed server lifecycle.
- [ ] All endpoints conform to agreed specification (paths, status codes, payload schemas).
- [ ] Performance assertions match spec thresholds.
- [ ] Streaming tests validate chunk structure (`delta`, `model`, `[DONE]`).
- [ ] No duplicate npm scripts; lint passes without warnings.

# Argus QA Re-Validation ‚Äì Feature 004 Story 3
**Analysis Date**: June 2025 (post-fix review)  
**Analysis Type**: Re-validation ‚Äì Implementation

## Summary of Fix Verification
‚úîÔ∏è All 46 Playwright integration tests pass locally with new `webServer` startup.
‚úîÔ∏è Validation errors now return proper 400 + `VALIDATION_ERROR` codes.
‚úîÔ∏è Streaming endpoint aligned to `/domain/llm/prompt` with `stream:true` flag.
‚úîÔ∏è Health endpoint path corrected to `/health` and response schema matches spec fields.

## Remaining Gaps & New Observations

| ID | Severity | Status | Description |
|----|----------|--------|-------------|
| VR3-1 | üü† HIGH | Open | Performance threshold in `health.spec.ts` still 400 ms (spec: 100 ms). Tests accommodate framework overhead rather than enforcing contract. |
| VR3-2 | üü° MEDIUM | Open | Streaming tests still omit assertions for `delta`, `model`, and `[DONE]` sentinel per spec; only checks `data:` lines and `event: done`. |
| VR3-3 | üü° MEDIUM | Open | Duplicate npm script keys remain in `package.json` (warnings logged during test run). |
| VR3-4 | üü° MEDIUM | Open | DRY violation ‚Äì per-file `apiContext` overrides persist instead of shared fixture extension. |
| VR3-5 | üü¢ LOW | Note | `console.log` statements present in tests; not blocking but noisy for CI. |

## Verdict
No blocking issues detected after fixes. Suite is green and critical spec deviations resolved. Medium-level cleanup items remain for maintainability and performance contract adherence.

**QA Analysis Complete** ‚Äì Re-validation passed with minor follow-ups.

## Deep Code Quality Review ‚Äì Story 3 Implementation

### Methodology
Focused scan of `apps/domain/src/**`, Playwright test harness, shared utilities, configuration, and package manifests. Criteria: linting hygiene, type-safety, security posture, performance, maintainability.

### Findings Overview
| ID | Severity | Category | Finding |
|----|----------|----------|---------|
| CQ3-1 | üî¥ BLOCKER (potential) | Security | `main.ts` enables CORS for a single hard-coded origin (`http://localhost:8765`). In prod this will fail legitimate origins or open risk if someone forgets to change it. Should be env-driven whitelist. |
| CQ3-2 | üü† HIGH | Maintainability | Duplicate `test:integration*` npm scripts (package root) invoke same command string; esbuild warns every run. Risk of silent divergence if edits occur. |
| CQ3-3 | üü† HIGH | Performance | `health.spec.ts` sets threshold 400 ms to mask Playwright overhead; spec contract is 100 ms. Consider measuring raw HTTP with light client or subtract harness overhead. |
| CQ3-4 | üü† HIGH | Observability | Provider code uses `console.log` & `.debug` gated only by `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`. Cloud environments may set `production` but still need debug. Use structured logger with configurable level. |
| CQ3-5 | üü° MEDIUM | Security | `OpenRouterProvider` passes `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` directly in `Authorization` header‚ÄîOK‚Äîbut logs stack traces including error message that may embed key if provider echoes it; ensure scrubber. |
| CQ3-6 | üü° MEDIUM | Code Smell | `generateId()` comment says "base36" but implementation returns hex; minor inconsistency can mislead future devs. |
| CQ3-7 | üü° MEDIUM | DRY | Each integration spec re-declares a local `apiContext` override duplicating boilerplate; recommend fixture composition. |
| CQ3-8 | üü¢ LOW | Accuracy | SSE implementation sends empty `data:` for `done` event; spec calls for `[DONE]`. Non-fatal but breaks client assumptions. |
| CQ3-9 | üü¢ LOW | Typings | Some DTO properties typed `any` (e.g. `_validator?: any`) to work around class-validator limitation. Acceptable but could use `unknown`. |

### Positive Highlights
‚Ä¢ Robust global `AllExceptionsFilter` with provider-specific error mapping and validation error flattening.  
‚Ä¢ DTO validation comprehensive (class-validator) with custom constraint `oneOfPromptOrMessages`.  
‚Ä¢ `OpenRouterProvider` includes timeout, memory and latency telemetry; good observability.  
‚Ä¢ Streaming generator properly handles `[DONE]` sentinel and JSON parse failures.

### Recommendations
1. Replace hard-coded CORS origin with env-driven array or wildcard under config flag (BLOCKER for prod).  
2. De-duplicate root `package.json` scripts.  
3. Introduce lightweight latency metric (e.g. plain `fetch`) to assert true 100 ms contract while leaving harness overhead separate.  
4. Standardise logging via NestJS `Logger` (already used) and remove stray `console.log` calls.  
5. Sanitize any provider error messages before logging.  
6. Harmonise `generateId()` comment with implementation; consider `nanoid`.  
7. Create shared `domainContext` fixture to remove per-file duplication.  
8. Update SSE `done` event to include `[DONE]` payload or align spec.

**Code Quality Review Complete** ‚Äì No new blocking issues for merge other than CORS configuration for production deployment. Minor/medium items created as recommendations.
