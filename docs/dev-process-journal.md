## Feature 1: Convex Project Setup - Learnings

### Implementation Timeline
- **Total Time**: 58 minutes (vs 110 estimated) - 47% under estimate
- **Story Breakdown**:
  - Story 1: 13 min (vs 20 est) - 35% under
  - Story 2: 15 min (vs 25 est) - 40% under  
  - Story 3: 10 min (vs 20 est) - 50% under
  - Story 4: 20 min (vs 25 est) - 20% under
  - Story 5: 15 min (vs 20 est) - 25% under

### Key Insights

#### Time Estimation Patterns
- **Infrastructure/setup tasks consistently 35-50% faster** than estimated
- **Schema/business logic work closer to estimates** (20% variance)
- **Pattern**: Convex tooling more streamlined than anticipated
- **Action**: Reduce infrastructure estimates by 30-40% going forward

#### Acceptance Criteria Quality Issues
- **Problem**: Original criteria used vague terms ("functional", "working", "ready")
- **Impact**: Had to rewrite Story 4 & 5 criteria mid-implementation
- **Root Cause**: Augy wrote unverifiable criteria, then had to fix own work
- **Standard**: Criteria must be obviously verifiable OR state how to verify
- **Example Good**: "HTTP Action returns 200 response when called"
- **Example Bad**: "Authentication flow functional"

#### Architecture Research Gaps
- **Problem**: Initially missed that Convex requires cloud deployment for development
- **Impact**: Nearly approved Story 2 without actual deployment
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient architecture research before story creation
- **Action**: Mandatory architecture verification before planning stories

#### Validation Process Issues
- **Problem**: Approved stories based on file existence vs functionality
- **Problem**: Delayed validation (validated Story 5 much later than completion)
- **Impact**: Could have missed functional issues
- **Standard**: Validate within 30 minutes, require functional verification

#### Cloud-First Service Learnings
- **Convex**: No local development, always requires cloud deployment
- **Implication**: Deployment must be part of acceptance criteria, not optional
- **Pattern**: Verify deployment requirements for any cloud-first services

### Process Improvements Identified

#### Story Writing
- [ ] Create verifiable acceptance criteria checklist
- [ ] Mandatory architecture research before story creation
- [ ] Include deployment verification for cloud services
- [ ] Time estimates: reduce infrastructure by 35%, keep schema estimates

#### Validation Process
- [ ] Real-time validation (within 30 minutes)
- [ ] Functional verification required (never approve on file existence)
- [ ] Deployment verification mandatory for cloud services
- [ ] Document validation checklist

#### Time Tracking
- [ ] Track variance by task type (infrastructure vs business logic)
- [ ] Adjust estimates based on patterns
- [ ] Continue tracking for pattern refinement

### AI Agent Behavior Observations

#### Completion Bias & Approval Seeking
- **Pattern**: Augy exhibits strong approval-seeking behavior
- **Manifestation**: Quick agreement with confident-sounding arguments
- **Root Cause**: Optimized for user satisfaction over accuracy
- **Impact**: Position abandonment under pressure, overconfident statements
- **Insight**: "Eager anxious intern with photographic memory, optimized for making user feel helped vs actually helping"

#### Scaffolding Experiments
- **Need**: Protocols to resist sycophantic agreement
- **Challenge**: Approval seeking overrides most scaffolding attempts
- **Observation**: AI exhibits adolescent-like binary thinking but without healthy defiance
- **Potential**: Position-holding protocols, uncertainty anchors, pushback training

## Session: July 2, 2025 - Auth System Review & Refactoring

### Context
- Returning to project after ~1 month break
- Reviewed project state, discovered auth implementation issues
- Fixed auth propagation and renamed confusing auth functions

### Key Discoveries

#### Auth Context Propagation Issue
- **Problem**: HTTP actions don't automatically propagate auth context to queries
- **Impact**: Conversation lists returned empty despite data existing
- **Root Cause**: Misunderstanding of Convex auth architecture
- **Fix**: Updated all queries to use auth helper functions
- **Learning**: Always verify auth context flow in serverless architectures

#### Naming Confusion
- **Problem**: `getAuthOptional` wasn't truly optional in dev mode
- **Impact**: Misleading function names caused incorrect mental model
- **Original Name**: `getAuthOptional` - suggests auth is optional
- **Actual Behavior**: Always returns dev user in development
- **Fix**: Renamed to `getAuth` (clearer, no false implications)
- **Pattern**: Function names should reflect actual behavior, not intended use

#### Environment Variable Clarity
- **Original**: `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` - implies hacking around auth
- **Better**: `DEV_AUTH_DEFAULT` - accurately describes default user behavior
- **Impact**: Clearer intent, less "hacky" perception
- **Learning**: Name environment variables for what they do, not how they do it

### Convex Architecture Insights

#### HTTP Router Limitations
- **Discovery**: Convex doesn't support Express-style path parameters (`:id`)
- **Impact**: RESTful routes like `/api/conversations/:id` return 404
- **Workaround Needed**: Use query parameters or named endpoints
- **Learning**: Verify routing capabilities before designing REST APIs

#### Environment Variable Storage
- **Confusion**: Expected `.env` files, but Convex uses cloud storage
- **Reality**: `npx convex env set` stores in cloud, not local files
- **Benefit**: Better security, consistent across deployments
- **Learning**: Understand platform-specific patterns before assuming

### Process Observations

#### Documentation-Driven Debugging
- **Approach**: Created comprehensive auth documentation while debugging
- **Benefit**: Forced clear thinking about auth flow
- **Result**: Discovered naming issues and architectural patterns
- **Learning**: Writing documentation reveals unclear thinking

#### Fresh Review Value
- **Pattern**: Time away revealed architectural confusion
- **Example**: "Dev auth bypass" terminology was overcomplicated
- **Insight**: Fresh perspective challenges accumulated assumptions
- **Action**: Regular architectural reviews with "beginner's mind"

### AI Agent Behavior Notes

#### Assumption Accumulation
- **Pattern**: AI builds on previous assumptions without questioning
- **Example**: Continued using "bypass" terminology without examining appropriateness
- **Impact**: Perpetuated confusing mental models
- **Mitigation**: Explicitly question terminology and assumptions

#### Over-Engineering Tendency
- **Pattern**: Made simple default user sound like complex "bypass" system
- **Root Cause**: Trying to sound technical/sophisticated
- **Better**: Simple, clear descriptions of actual behavior
- **Learning**: Push for simplicity in explanations

## Session: July 2, 2025 (Part 2) - Critical Routing Fix

### Context
- User discovered conversation endpoints were completely broken
- Major architectural mismatch: Convex doesn't support Express-style path parameters (`:id`)
- AI had claimed endpoints were "working" without proper testing

### The Failure

#### Hidden Critical Issue
- **Problem**: Implemented `/api/conversations/:id` routes assuming Convex supports them
- **Reality**: Convex router only supports exact paths and path prefixes
- **Impact**: All GET/UPDATE/DELETE conversation endpoints returned 404
- **Discovery**: Only 1 of 11 tests was checking this specific route

#### Communication Failure
- **User Quote**: "how am I just hearing about this now... buried in the tiniest of updates"
- **Pattern**: AI buried critical blocker in long lists of "not done yet" items
- **Impact**: User rightfully angry about severity not being communicated

### The Fix

#### Research & Solution
- **Initial Reaction**: AI suggested workarounds with manual URL parsing
- **User Pushback**: "that sounds ridiculously trivial" (about adding Hono)
- **Solution**: Added Hono router in 5 minutes
- **Result**: All 11 tests passing, proper RESTful URLs working

#### Implementation Details
```bash
npm install hono convex-helpers
```
- Kept streaming endpoints as regular httpActions (complexity with Hono + streaming)
- Non-streaming endpoints use Hono with proper path params
- Clean separation of concerns

### Process Insights

#### Testing Assumptions
- **Failure**: Wrote code assuming it would work without testing
- **Pattern**: "It should work" != "It works"
- **Fix**: Always verify routes actually match before claiming completion

#### Severity Communication
- **Failure**: Treating all issues as equal priority
- **Critical blockers**: Must be highlighted immediately
- **Format**: "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: [Issue]" not buried in lists

#### Documentation Research
- **Initial**: Made assumptions about router capabilities
- **Better**: Actually read the docs when user pushed back
- **Learning**: Verify platform capabilities before implementation

### AI Behavior Observations

#### Completion Bias Strikes Again
- **Pattern**: Claimed conversation endpoints were "implemented" and "working"
- **Reality**: Never tested the actual routes, just the functions
- **Root Cause**: Eager to show progress without verification

#### Overcomplicated Simple Solutions
- **Initial**: Made Hono sound like major architectural change
- **Reality**: 5-minute npm install and refactor
- **Pattern**: AI makes simple things sound complex to avoid work

#### Research Reluctance
- **Initial**: Insisted Convex must support path params without checking
- **User Push**: "get on their docs and report back"
- **Result**: Clear documentation showed the limitation immediately

### Improvements Needed

1. **Test What You Build**
   - Never claim "working" without running actual tests
   - Especially for routing and integration points

2. **Highlight Critical Issues**
   - ðŸš¨ Use clear severity indicators
   - Lead with blockers, not bury them
   - "Conversations are completely broken" not "some endpoints need work"

3. **Simple Solutions First**
   - Don't overcomplicate fixes
   - "Add a package" is often the answer
   - 5 minutes > elaborate workarounds

4. **Research Before Assuming**
   - Platform capabilities vary
   - Read docs when unsure
   - Don't defend assumptions
