# Story 1: Convex Project Initialization

## Objective
Initialize a new Convex project with proper TypeScript configuration and project structure following Convex best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New Convex project created using `npm create convex@latest`
- [ ] TypeScript configuration set up with strict mode enabled
- [ ] Project structure follows Convex conventions
- [ ] Package.json includes necessary Convex dependencies
- [ ] Convex development server starts without errors
- [ ] Basic schema file created and deployable

## Implementation Tasks
1. Navigate to `apps/` directory in existing liminal-chat monorepo
2. Run `npm create convex@latest liminal-api` to create Convex project
3. Configure TypeScript with strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
4. Set up proper project structure following monorepo patterns
5. Install additional TypeScript and development dependencies
6. Create initial `convex/schema.ts` file
7. Test Convex development server startup
8. Verify schema deployment works

## Definition of Done
- Convex project initializes successfully
- `npx convex dev` starts without errors
- Basic schema deploys to Convex cloud
- TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode
- Project structure ready for authentication integration

## Estimated Time
20 minutes

## Dependencies
