# Story 5: Integration Readiness Verification

## Objective
Verify that the Convex project is properly configured and ready for Vercel AI SDK integration and subsequent feature development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Node.js runtime verified: HTTP Action with `"use node"` directive executes successfully
- [ ] HTTP Actions working: `/test` endpoint returns 200 response when called
- [ ] Environment variables accessible: HTTP Action can read `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` variable
- [ ] Authentication integration: HTTP Action can call `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` without errors
- [ ] Database integration: HTTP Action can query users table and return results
- [ ] Performance targets met: Convex dashboard shows function execution <100ms
- [ ] Setup documentation exists: `README.md` contains complete deployment instructions

## Implementation Tasks
1. Test Node.js runtime with `"use node"` directive
2. Create and test basic HTTP Action
3. Verify environment variable access in actions
4. Test integration between authentication and database
5. Run performance benchmarks on core operations
6. Update project documentation with setup steps
7. Create integration test suite

## Definition of Done
- Node.js runtime works correctly in Convex actions
- HTTP Actions can be created and called successfully
- Environment variables accessible in Node.js runtime
- Authentication and database work together seamlessly
- All performance targets met (startup <10s, DB ops <100ms)
- Setup documentation complete and accurate

## Estimated Time
20 minutes

## Dependencies
- Story 1: Convex Project Initialization
- Story 2: Clerk Authentication Setup  
- Story 3: Development Environment Configuration
- Story 4: Core Database Schema Setup

## Blocks
- Feature 2: Vercel AI SDK Integration (needs verified Node.js runtime)
- All subsequent features requiring HTTP Actions
