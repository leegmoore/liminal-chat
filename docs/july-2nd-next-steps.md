- Real-time streaming display

### 2. CLI Integration ‚ùå
- Recreate CLI package connecting to Convex endpoints
- Update from old edge server URLs (http://localhost:8787)
- Implement provider commands
- Add conversation management commands

### 3. Agent System (Feature 7 - Core Feature) ‚ùå

- Agent registry and management
- Tool system integration
- Multi-agent conversation support

## Features 2-8 Progress

### Completed ‚úÖ
- Feature 2: Vercel AI SDK integration (100%)
- Feature 3: Testing infrastructure (90%)
- Feature 4: Multi-provider support (100%)

### Remaining ‚ùå
- Feature 5: Model/Provider DTOs with persistence
- Feature 6: Model tools registry
- Feature 7: Agent system with orchestration

## Recommendations

1. **Quick Win**: Update auth documentation is done ‚úÖ
2. **High Impact**: Build the Web UI (1-2 days)
3. **Core Feature**: Implement Agent System (2-3 days)
4. **Foundation**: CLI Integration (1 day)

The Convex backend is now fully functional with all endpoints working. The next step should be either the Web UI (for user-facing functionality) or the Agent System (for core AI Roundtable feature).
