# Task 7: E2E Validation

## Execution Time
- Started: 2025-06-07 20:25 UTC
- Completed: 2025-06-07 20:30 UTC

## Steps Performed

### 1. Fixed Import Paths
- Updated `provider-health.service.ts` import path for openrouter-models.json
- Updated `openrouter.provider.ts` import path for openrouter-models.json
- Fixed TypeScript type issue with model configuration

### 2. Added Service Management Scripts
- Created start/stop/restart scripts in root package.json
- Documented new scripts in CLAUDE.md
- Scripts added:
  - `pnpm domain:start/stop/restart`
  - `pnpm edge:start/stop/restart`
  - `pnpm cli:run`
  - `pnpm start:all/stop:all/restart:all`

### 3. Restarted Domain Server
```bash
pnpm -w run domain:restart
pnpm -w run check:domain
# Result: {"status":"healthy","service":"domain","timestamp":"2025-06-07T20:28:59.403Z","version":"1.0.0"}
```

### 4. Verified Provider Registration
```bash
pnpm -w run local-curl GET 8766/domain/llm/providers
```
Result: OpenRouter now appears in the available providers list with all 11 configured models.

### 5. E2E Test - CLI ‚Üí Edge ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí OpenRouter
```bash
pnpm -w run local-curl POST 8787/api/v1/llm/prompt \
  '{"prompt": "Say hello from OpenRouter", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "openai/gpt-4.1"}'
```
Result: Successfully received response from OpenRouter via GPT-4.1

## Findings

### ‚úÖ Working
- OpenRouter provider successfully integrated and registered
- E2E flow working: CLI ‚Üí Edge ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí OpenRouter ‚Üí Response
- Provider health checks showing OpenRouter as available
- Model configuration loaded from JSON file
- Error mapping working correctly
- API key configuration working

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations Discovered
- Model selection is environment-based, not request-based
- The `model` parameter in the request is ignored
- Current DTO doesn't include a model field
- All requests to OpenRouter use the model configured in OPENROUTER_MODEL env var

### üìù Notes
- This limitation is acceptable for Story 1 (basic integration)
- Per-request model selection could be added in a future story
- The integration proves OpenRouter can be used as a provider

## Evidence
- Health check confirmed: Domain server running
- Provider list shows: `"availableProviders":["echo","openrouter"]`
- Successful API response with usage stats
- All 11 configured models appear in provider discovery

## Task Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - E2E validation successful with noted limitations
